# **App Name**: Olipop Parallax

## Core Features:

- Drink Variant Switching: Switch between drink variants (Cherry, Orange, Lemon) with associated data like name, description, theme color, and WebP sequence using PREV/NEXT controls.
- Parallax Animation: Implement a full-screen hero section with a WebP image sequence that animates based on scroll position, creating a parallax effect.
- Content Management: Manage drink information. Update text overlays on the hero section and other website sections with dynamic content.
- Loading Experience: Display a loading screen with a progress bar to ensure the WebP sequences are fully preloaded before the hero section is revealed.
- Section Navigation: Implement smooth-scrolling navigation to Product, Ingredients, Nutrition, Reviews, FAQ, and Contact sections with an active section indicator.
- Customization tool: Leverage a generative AI tool to assess the sentiment of customer reviews, then either incorporate the review directly into the landing page, or create a summarized version of the reviews using different writing styles.
- Footer Implementation: Create a footer with brand information, links, social icons, and copyright text.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: White (#FFFFFF) for text and highlights against the dark background, emphasizing the clean, modern design.
- Background color: Near-black or charcoal (#121212) to create a cinematic, premium feel and ensure the text is highly legible.
- Accent color: Light gray (#D3D3D3) for secondary text, borders, and subtle UI elements, maintaining a monochrome color palette.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif, for a modern, neutral look.
- Use minimal, monochrome social icons in the bottom center of the hero and in the footer.
- Full-screen hero section with a WebP sequence background. Overlay text block on the left side with drink name, subtitle, and description. Right-side vertical navigation strip for switching drink variants.
- Parallax scroll behavior where the WebP sequence frame index is mapped to the scroll position for a smooth, cinematic effect.
